Welcome to the repository for the official landing page of **ProseFlow**, the universal AI co-pilot that melts into your workflow. This website is built with **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript** to provide a stunning, informative, and interactive experience for users learning about ProseFlow.

This repository contains the source code for the landing page itself, not the ProseFlow desktop application. For the application's codebase, please visit the main [**ProseFlow GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/LSXPrime/ProseFlow).

## About This Website

*   **Introduce ProseFlow:** A polished, highly animated landing page communicates the core concepts of "Fluid Intelligence" and the application's key features.
*   **Build Trust:** Emphasize the project's commitment to being free, open-source, and privacy-respecting.
*   **Visualize Capabilities:** Feature interactive sections like the "Feature Universe" to creatively display the app's extensive functionality.
*   **Simplify Downloads:** Provide an intelligent download section that automatically detects the user's OS and architecture to offer the correct build.

## Features

*   **Smart Downloads:** Automatically detects the user's OS and CPU architecture to recommend the most appropriate download link.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Fetches the latest release version directly from the GitHub API to ensure the download information is always up-to-date.
*   **Fully Responsive:** A beautiful and functional experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
